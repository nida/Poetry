Time

 

I was a strong believer
In present: today,
In tomorrow
In present: now
And In love forever;

I drew hearts
I drew arrows
I wrote names and crossed
My dreams were infinite
My dreams were a little light
Blinking, Shinning, Waiting for a break
A switch between
A case splendour
of butterflies fluttering
A case magnificent
of orchids trembling
A case majestic
of wind gushing
My body sensing greater than my eye
My body wishing greater than this sky
My skin looking beyond today.


I sit alone split between a story and song
Writing a word for each right or wrong
While I want to        
Talk About Now   
Talk About Time   
Try to replace mountains with Hills 
Clone Object of Rainbows
Throw new Expression in joy
Catch expression of New Harmony   
I wander into a dreamland 
Of Longing
Of Primitive blabber
Of Double rose Flower Showers

                                
If blushing hearts starts with emojiâ€™s      
Telling Stories of I < 3 
If lyrics exchange music not null Notes   
If not this dreamland 
I want to
Count Date from here
Count Time from here
Till you, me: us
Hearts contains in each other
Creating story in gif

If not talk about present        
I want to return
To unicorns 
To sunshine 
To chocolates 
To candies
To gif
Of us together

 

For it feels like a dream      
If we talk in flowers
In Crypto Primitive SIGNATURE
In Secret Key we talk hearts
I want to continue
Try
For We Might Be Living a Story   
Catch Exception of Words    
Throw into Universe
Finally
Flying wind in hair
Being Free   
We with just us
In present
Today now
In love forever
